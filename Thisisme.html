Hello! My name is Asma Malik and I am majoring in Computer Science because I want to become a Data Analyst.I am very much into Sci-Fi and action movies. I love Marvel movies, my favorite marvel movies is Iron Man. I also like to watch Anime as well, I am currently watching Attack on Titan. The main reason I like this show is because of the way they use CGI to create their characters. The moment I could tell the difference between CGI and hand drawn characters made, actually blew my mind. This culture of technology really helped me me embrace the idea of learning about computers. It grabbed my interest as a kid and it has never changed since.
